SharingTheLove
==============

SharingTheLove is a Wordpress plugin which injects @rfreebern's Falling-in-Love into a Wordpress site.

Hearts will slowly drift down the page on Valentine's day.

Falling-in-Love does all the heavy lifting. You can find it at http://blog.rnf.me/Falling-in-Love/

The plugin is written by John Romkey of Blue Forest Research, LLC.
